# SupTracked UI

Individual pages are kept in the `jade` folder. Everything in the `lib` folder is on every page, minified; jade components like headers go in the `jade-components` folder. Per-page JS logic goes in the `js` folder, where it will also live in `dist`, minified.

To deploy, serve the `dist` directory.

I know this uses jQuery. I know it shouldn't. This is just a mockup before I start learning a new framework to rebuild it in.
